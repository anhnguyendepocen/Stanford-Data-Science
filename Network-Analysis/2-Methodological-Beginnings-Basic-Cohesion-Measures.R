# Lab 2

# The purpose of this lab is to acquire basic cohesion

# 4. HETEROGENEITY 
###

# Miller and McPherson write about processes of homophily and
# here we take a brief look at one version of this issue. 
# In particular, we look at the extent to which each actor's
# "associates" (friend, advisor, boos) are heterogenous or not.

# We'll use a statistic called the IQV, or Index of Qualitative
# Variation. This is just an implementation of Blau's Index of
# Heterogeneity (known to economists as the Herfindahl-Hirschman
# index), normalized so that perfect heterogeneity (i.e., equal 
# distribution across categories) equals 1.

# NOTE that this code only works with categorical variables that 
# have been numerically coded to integer values that ascend
# sequentially from 0; you may have to recode your data to get this
# to work properly.
# We are interested in many of the attributes of nodes.  To save 
# time and to make our lives better we are going to create a function
# that will provide an IQV statistic for any network and for
# any categorical variable.  A function is a simple way to
# create code that is both reusable and easier to edit.

# Functions have names and receive arguments.  For example,
# anytime you call table() you are calling the table function.
# We could write code to duplicate the table function for each
# of our variables, but it is faster to write a single general tool
# that will provide frequencies for any variable. If I have
# a dataframe with the variable gender and I want to see the
# split of males and females I would pass the argument
# "dataframe$gender" to the table function. We follow a
# similar model here. Understanding each step is less important
# than understanding the usefulness and power of functions.

get_iqvs <- function(graph, attribute) {

#we have now defined a function, get_iqvs, that will take the
# graph "graph" and find the iqv statistic for the categorical
# variable "attribute." Within this function whenever we use the 
#variables graph or attribute they correspond to the graph and
# variable we passed (provided) to the function

mat <- get.adjacency(graph)
				
# To make this function work on a wide variety of variables we
# find out how many coded levels (unique responses) exist for
# the attribute variable programatically

	attr_levels = get.vertex.attribute(graph,
	                                   attribute,
	                                   V(graph))
	
	num_levels = length(unique(attr_levels))
	iqvs = rep(0, nrow(mat))

# Now that we know how many levels exist we want to loop
# (go through) each actor in the network. Loops iterate through
# each value in a range.  Here we are looking through each ego
# in the range of egos starting at the first and ending at the
# last.  The function nrow provides the number of rows in an
# object and the ":" opperand specifies the range.  Between
# the curly braces of the for loop ego will represent exactly
# one value between 1 and the number of rows in the graph
# object, iterating by one during each execution of the loop.

	for (ego in 1:nrow(mat)) {
		
		# initialize actor-specific variables
		alter_attr_counts = rep(0, num_levels)
		num_alters_this_ego = 0
		sq_fraction_sum = 0

# For each ego we want to check each tied alter for the same
# level on the variable attribute as the ego.
	
		for (alter in 1:ncol(mat)) {
			
			# only examine alters that are actually tied to ego
			if (mat[ego, alter] == 1) {
				
				num_alters_this_ego = num_alters_this_ego + 1

				# get the alter's level on the attribute 
				alter_attr = get.vertex.attribute(graph, 
				    attribute, (alter - 1))

				# increment the count of alters with this level
				# of the attribute by 1
				alter_attr_counts[alter_attr + 1] =
				    alter_attr_counts[alter_attr + 1] + 1
			}
		}

		# now that we're done looping through all of the alters,
		# get the squared fraction for each level of the attribute
		# out of the total number of attributes
		for (i in 1:num_levels) {
			attr_fraction = alter_attr_counts[i] /
			    num_alters_this_ego
			sq_fraction_sum = sq_fraction_sum + attr_fraction ^ 2
		}
		
		# now we can compute the ego's blau index...
		blau_index = 1 - sq_fraction_sum
		
		# and the ego's IQV, which is just a normalized blau index
		iqvs[ego] = blau_index / (1 - (1 / num_levels))
	}

# The final part of a function returns the calculated value.
#  So if we called get_iqvs(testgraph, gender) return would
# provide the iqvs for gender in the test graph.  If we are also
# intersted in race we could simply change the function call
# to get_iqvs(testgraph, race).  No need to write all this
# code again for different variables.

	return(iqvs)
}

# which is already coded 0-4, so no recoding is needed.
