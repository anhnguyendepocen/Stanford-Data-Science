# LAB 6 - Blockmodeling Lab                                              
# The point of this lab is to introduce students to blockmodeling 
# techniques that call for a metric of structural equivalence, a method
# and rationale for the selection of the number of positions, and then 
# a means of summary representation (mean cutoff and reduced graph 
# presentation). Students will be shown how to identify positions using
# correlation as a metric of structural equivalence (euclidean distance 
# is used in earlier lab), and they will be taught how to identify more
# isomorphic notions of role-position using the triad census. Last, the 
# lab calls upon the user to compare positional techniques and come up 
# with a rationale for why they settle on one over another.

# is the default.

# hclust() performs a hierarchical agglomerative NetCluster 
# operation based on the values in the dissimilarity matrix 
# yielded by as.dist() above. The standard visualization is a 
# dendrogram. By default, hclust() agglomerates clusters via a
# "complete linkakage" algorithm, determining cluster proximity
# by looking at the distance of the two points across clusters
# that are farthest away from one another. This can be changed via
# the "method" parameter.

# different numbers of clusters and assign vertices to clusters
# as appropriate. For example:
cutree(m182_task_social_hclust, k=2)

# Now we'll try to figure out the number of clusters that best 
# describes the underlying data. To do this, we'll loop through

# the number of actors in the network). For each solution
# corresponding to a given number of clusters, we'll use cutree()
# to assign the vertices to their respective clusters 
# corresponding to that solution.
#
# From this, we can generate a matrix of within- and between-
# cluster correlations. Thus, when there is one cluster for each 
# vertex in the network, the cell values will be identical to the
# observed correlation matrix, and when there is one cluster for 
# the whole network, the values will all be equal to the average
# correlation across the observed matrix.
#
# We can then correlate each by-cluster matrix with the observed
# correlation matrix to see how well the by-cluster matrix fits
# the data. We'll store the correlation for each number of

# First, we initialize a vector for storing the correlations and

### NOTE ON DEDUCTIVE CLUSTERING

# It's pretty straightforward, using the code above, to explore
# your own deductive NetCluster. Simply supply your own cluster
# vector, where the elements in the vector are in the same order
# as the vertices in the matrix, and the values represent the
# cluster to which each vertex belongs. 
#
# For example, if you believed that actors 2, 7, and 8 formed one
# group, actor 16 former another group, and everyone else formed 
# a third group, you could represent this as follows:
deductive_clusters = c(1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
                       1, 3)

# You could then examine the fitness of this cluster configuration
# as follows:
deductive_cluster_cor_mat <- generate_cluster_cor_mat(
  m182_task_social_cors,
  deductive_clusters)
deductive_cluster_cor_mat
gcor(deductive_cluster_cor_mat, m182_task_social_cors)

# 4. HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING ON TRIAD CENSUS
###

# Another way to think about roles within a network is by looking 
# at the triads that each actor belongs to. We can then use 
# correlations between triad-type memberships to identify people 
# with similar roles regardless of the specific people with whom
# they interact.

# First, we'll generate an individual-level triad census of the 
# network using triadcensus() from the triads package.

# Next, we'll generate a matrix of correlations between actors 
# in the network based on their similarity in triad-type 
# membership. Note that the cor() function in R operates on 
# columns, not rows, so in order to get correlations between 
# the actors in the network we have to transpose it.

# 5. FACTOR ANALYSIS
###

# Note that although we are conducting a principal components
# analysis (PCA), which is technically not exactly the same as
# factor analysis, we will use the term "factor" to describe the
# individual components in our PCA. 

# PCA is often used in network analysis as a form of detecting 
# individuals global positioning. We say "global" because these
# clusters aren't defined on local cohesion but from the overall 
# pattern of ties individuals have with all others (structural 
# equivalence). Identifying the first two largest components that
# organize the variance in tie patterns is one way of doing this.

# We'll analyze the 4n x n matrix generated above.

# First, we want to determine the ideal number of components
# (factors) to extract. We'll do this by examining the eigenvalues
# in a scree plot and examining how each number of factors stacks
# up to a few proposed non-graphical solutions to selecting the
# optimal number of components, available via the nFactors
# package. 
ev <- eigen(cor(m182_task_social_matrix)) # get eigenvalues
ap <- parallel(subject=nrow(m182_task_social_matrix),
		var=ncol(m182_task_social_matrix),
		rep=100,cent=.05)
nS <- nScree(ev$values, ap$eigen$qevpea)

pdf("6.6_m182_studentnet_task_social_pca_scree.pdf")

# To draw a line across the graph where eigenvalues are = 1,
# use the following code:
plotnScree(nS) 
abline(h=1)
dev.off()


# For more information on this procedure, please see 
# the references provided in the parallel() documentation
# (type "?parallel" in the R command line with the package
# loaded).

# Now we'll run a principal components analysis on the matrix,
# using the number of factors determined above (note this may not
# be the same number as you get):
pca_m182_task_social = principal(m182_task_social_matrix, nfactors=5, rotate="varimax") 

# Let's take a look at the results in the R terminal:
pca_m182_task_social 

# You can see the standardized loadings for each factor for each
# node. Note that R sometimes puts the factors in a funky order
# (e.g. RC1, RC2, RC5, RC4, RC3) but all of the factors are there.
# You can see that the SS loadings, proportion of variance
# explained and cumulative variance explained is provided below. A
# Chi Square test of the factors and various other statistics are
# provided below. 

# Note that the eigenvalues can be accessed via the following
# command:
pca_m182_task_social$values

# Now we will use the factor loadings to cluster and compare that
# to our other NetCluster techniques, using dendrograms.

# Take the distance based on Euclidian Distance
m182_task_factor_dist = dist(pca_m182_task_social$loadings)

# And cluster
